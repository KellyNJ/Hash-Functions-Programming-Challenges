# Programming Challenges
1. Implement birthday attack simulation
   - Find collision in reduced hash (24 bits)
   - How many attempts needed?
2. Build rainbow table
   - For 4-character passwords
   - Measure space/time tradeoff
3. Length-extension attack demo
   - Given SHA-256(secret||known)
   - Compute SHA-256(secret||known||append)
